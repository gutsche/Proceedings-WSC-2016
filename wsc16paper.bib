  abstract={The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN near Geneva is the world's newest and most powerful tool for Particle Physics research. It is designed to collide proton beams with a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV and an unprecedented luminosity of 10 34 cm −2 s −1 . It can also collide heavy (Pb) ions with an energy of 2.8 TeV per nucleon and a peak luminosity of 10 27 cm −2 s −1 . In this paper, the machine design is described.}

  abstract={The increased energy and luminosity of the LHC in the run-2 data taking period requires a more selective trigger menu in order to satisfy the physics goals of ATLAS. Therefore the electronics of the central trigger system is upgraded to allow for a larger variety and more sophisticated trigger criteria. In addition, the software controlling the central trigger processor (CTP) has been redesigned to allow the CTP to accommodate three freely configurable and separately operating sets of sub detectors, each independently using the almost full functionality of the trigger hardware. This new approach and its operational advantages are discussed as well as the hardware upgrades.}

OSG provides support for and evolution of the infrastructure through activities that cover operations, security, software, troubleshooting, addition of new capabilities, and support for existing and engagement with new communities. The OSG SciDAC-2 project provides specific activities to manage and evolve the distributed infrastructure and support it's use. The innovative aspects of the project are the maintenance and performance of a collaborative (shared & common) petascale national facility over tens of autonomous computing sites, for many hundreds of users, transferring terabytes of data a day, executing tens of thousands of jobs a day, and providing robust and usable resources for scientific groups of all types and sizes.

To provide time dependent calibration, a database snapshot scheme was devised. The two high capacity filesystems, localized at the opposite coasts of US and interconnected via Globus-Online protocol, were used in this setup, which resulted with a highly scalable Cloud-based extension of STAR computing resources. The system was in continuous operation for over 3 months.}

This presentation discusses a detailed analysis of the costs of operating and maintaining the RACF (RHIC and ATLAS Computing Facility) compute cluster at Brookhaven National Lab and compares them with the cost of cloud computing resources under various usage scenarios. An extrapolation of likely future cost effectiveness of dedicated computing resources is also presented.}

  abstract={The CernVM File System (CernVM-FS) provides a scalable, reliable and close to zero-maintenance software distribution service. It was developed to assist HEP collaborations to deploy their software on the worldwide-distributed computing infrastructure used to run their data processing applications. CernVM-FS is deployed on a wide range of computing resources, ranging from powerful worker nodes at Tier 1 grid sites to simple virtual appliances running on volunteer computers. We present a new approach to stage updates and changes into the file system, which aims to reduce the delay in distributing a software release to less than an hour. In addition, it significantly reduces the complexity with respect to both required capabilities of the master storage as well as installation and maintenance. Furthermore, we will discuss new requirements for additional features on the client side that have arisen from HEP community feedback.}
